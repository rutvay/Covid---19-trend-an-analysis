# Covid-19-trend-and-analysis
<h2> Introduciton </h2>
<p>This project discusses covid trends and analyse different relations using the dataset sample of india, using various methods of visulaizing the data the trens and outcomes are predicted. 
<h2>Types of libraries used</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Pandas</dt>
  <dd>  Used for readint the csv file into readable data formate and to perform analyis function/dd>
  <dt>Matplot Lib</dt>
  <dd>  Used for analysing the data and describing the figure size and other various specification</dd>
  <dt>Seaborn</dt>
  <dd> Used for plotting various plots and graphs that helps us to visualize and analyse data</dd>
  <dt> fbprophet </dt>
  <dd> Used to predict trends in tiem-series datasets , this library is rohbust to outliers thats the main reason of useing it here.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Prediction</h2>
<p> Predicted daily cases from the past data and dsiplayed the effect of lockdown on Covid - 19 chart with sample state as Gujarat </p>
<p> With the help of fbprophet you can predict trends in time series data with outliers as in this data set.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
  
<p>My model predicted daily average cases in Gujarat but due to external factors like Lockdown, the predictions made were not very accurate and differ from real case scenario.</P>
